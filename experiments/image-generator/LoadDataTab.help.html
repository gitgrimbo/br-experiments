<p>This section provides the ability to load data from external sources, such as Google Sheets.</p>
<p>
Some SVGs have embedded data (that the author of the SVG has embedded), and that will also appear here.
Embedded data is set in a <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element in the SVG with <code>id="sample.data"</code>.
Embedded data is in JSON format and has the form <code>"data-name": ["list", "of", "items"]</code>,
where you can have multiple data-names for different data.
For example:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
&lt;svg&gt;
...
  &lt;text id="sample.data"&gt;{
    "data.player.position":[
      "C","P","1B","2B","3B",
      "SS","LF","CF","RF"
    ],
    "data.player.name":[
      "Rich Green",
      "Miguel Ju√°rez",
      "Nestor Martinez"
    ]
  }&lt;/text&gt;
...
&lt;/svg&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>The loaded data can then be used to set values within the SVG image.</p>
<p>
Once the data is loaded you will be able to view it all below.
But you need to use the SET IMAGE DATA tab to actually use the data.
