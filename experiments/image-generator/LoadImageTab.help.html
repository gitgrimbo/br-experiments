This section provides the ability to load an SVG image from locations such as:
<ul>
<li>a pre-defined source (this website)
<li>any public URL
<li>Google Photos
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you want to be able to set custom data/values in the SVG, then the SVG must have elements with ids.
These ids are used by the site to pick out specific elements in the SVG.
</p>
<p>
Currently, simple text values can be set, such as players names and image URLs. 
</p>
<p>
When you are happy with the image, press the CREATE PNG button to create a PNG version of the SVG.
This PNG can then be used in social media posts.
